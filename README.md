### About Me

I'm a data scientist with a background in statistics and a passion for making complex ideas accessible. I recently earned my MS in Statistics from Brigham Young University, where I focused on machine learning, Bayesian methods, and environmental data analysis.

These days, I'm exploring how to use LLMs effectively, tinkering with home servers and lightweight devops, and always looking for new ways to turn data into insight. I also run a blog called Data Science Magic, where I share helpful guides and practical tips for students and early-career professionals in data science.

I'm always up for a good projectâ€”whether it's analyzing ecological data, building smarter models, or spinning up a Raspberry Pi robot for fun.
